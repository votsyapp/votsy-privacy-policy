        <p>At <strong>Votsy</strong>, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Votsy mobile application.</p>
        <p>By using Votsy, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>This information is used solely for the purpose of authentication, providing you access to the app, and enabling features like account management.</p>

        <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>When you create a vote in Votsy, we store the content you provide (such as vote titles and options). This allows you to manage, view, or delete the votes you've created.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Non-Personal Information</h3>

            <li>General app usage data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected for statistical purposes and to improve the user experience in Votsy.</p>
